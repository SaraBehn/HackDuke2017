		<h1> Welcome</h1>
		<h2> You may not have a home, but you are not alone.</h2>
		<h3> Our mission</h3>
		<p> We want to make a place for individuals who are currently homeless to share their stories. This data can then be used for research, but most of all, we want to show that these are people. They have faces and names. Let's recognize them. </p>
		<h3> Who we are</h3>
		<p> We are four students from Duke University who wanted to use HackDuke2017 as an opportunity to humanize the dehumanized.</p>
